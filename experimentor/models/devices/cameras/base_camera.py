    Base Camera Model
    =================
    Camera class with the base methods. Having a base class exposes the general API for working with cameras.
    This file is important to keep track of the methods which are exposed to the View.
    The class BaseCamera should be subclassed when developing new Models for other cameras. This ensures that all the
    methods are automatically inherited and there are no breaks downstream.

    Conventions
    -----------
    Images are 0-indexed. Therefore, a camera with (1024px X 1024px) will be used as img[0:1024, 0:1024] (remember
    Python leaves out the last value in the slice.

    Region of Interest is specified with the coordinates of the corners. A full-frame with the example above would be
    given by X=[0,1023], Y=[0,1023]. Be careful, since the maximum width (or height) of the camera is 1024.

    The camera keeps track of the coordinates of the initial pixel. For full-frame, this will always be [0,0]. When
    croping, the corner-pixel will change. It is very important to keep track of this value when building a GUI, since
    after the first crop, if the user wants to crop even further, the information has to be referenced to the already
    cropped area.

    Notes
    -----
    **IMPORTANT** Whatever new function is implemented in a specific model, it should be first declared in the
    BaseCamera class. In this way the other models will have access to the method and the program will keep running
    (perhaps with the wrong behavior though).

    Parameters
    ----------
    camera: str or int
        Parameter to identify the camera when loading or initializing it.

    Attributes
    ----------
    AQUISITION_MODE: dict
        Different acquisition modes: Continuous, Single, Keep last.
    cam_num: str or int
        This parameter will be used to identify the camera when loading or initializing it.
    running: bool
        Whether the camera is running or not
    max_width: int
        Maximum width, in pixels
    max_height: int
        Maximum height, in pixels
    data_type: np data type
        The data type of the images generated by the camera. This can be used to allocate the correct amount of memory
        in buffers, or to reduce data before displaying it. For example, ``np.uint16``.
    temp_image: np.array
        It stores the last image acquired by the camera. Useful for user interfaces that need to display images at a
        rate different than the acquisition rate.
