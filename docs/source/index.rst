Experimentor
============

**A flexible package for experiment control and automation**

Experimentor is a Python package aimed at simplifying the task of controlling experiments in various fields. The starting point of the development was a nano photonics setup and therefore the examples and the bulk of the code makes references to optical microscopes, but by no means this project is limited to them.

The documentation will cover from the basics of installation in a Python virtual environment to more complex tasks such as adding new features to the package.
