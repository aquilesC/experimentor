Starting to use the Experimentor
================================

The package provides the basic classes and functions to communicate with devices and plan experiments. The package was designed to impose a workflow that guarantees the user will be able to plan an experiment from start to finish.

Experimentor is packaged with the folder containing the main code, i.e. the package itself, and a folder of examples that show some cases of how the program can be used.

The logic behind Experimentor is that the parameters that a user has to set for performing an experiment are layed out in YAML files. So, for example, the port at which a photodiode is plugged is defined in a yaml file. The steps of the experiment are also layed out in a YAML file, in order to make clear what needs to be set, changed, scanned, etc. These files are then read and passed to a special class of Experimentor.

Experimentor defines only general classes and methods that enable the user to define a common approach to the problems, however every experiment is different and has to be developed by each user. The examples folder are a good starting point for lerning, as well as the explanations found hereafter.

The steps needed to make an experiment using the Experimentor are as follow:

   First one has to define which devices are going to be used and make a YAML file for them.
   Then, the steps of the experiment are layed out in another YAML file.
   A class based on Experimentor is written, with methods for every step layed out in the YAML file.
   In principle a GUI can be built to modify the parameters passed to the experimentor class.

Each step is thought in order to force the user to be in control of his/her experiment and not to rely on preconceived concepts that can be far from how the setup actually works.

Defining devices, sensors and actuators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Every experiment should start by defining what devices, sensors and actuators are going to be used. The general structure is that devices communicate with the computer, while sensors and actuators are plugged into devices. For example an acquisition card such as an oscilloscope is a *device*. A photodiode connected to it is a *sensor*, while a piezo stage connected to the output of a function generator is an *actuator*.

In the same fashion, a tunable laser is a device and the wavelength is an actuator. In this way the same structure of programs can be preserved throughout different projects. This is specially handy when developing GUIs, since it enables the iteration through all sensors or all actuators of a given device.

Devices, sensors and actuators are defined through YAML files. The examples folder contains some general files that show how to do it. Generally speaking it would look like something like this::

   NI-DAQ:
     name: NI-DAQ
     type: daq
     model: ni
     number: 2
     driver: experimentor.models.daq.ni/ni
     connection:
       type: daq
       port: 2
     trigger: external
     trigger_source: PFI0

No field is required a priory, but giving a name is highly recommended. All the other fields are self explanatory. Sensors and actuators are defined in a similar way::

   NI-DAQ:
     Stage 1:
       port: 1
       type: analog
       mode: output
       description: Example analog Out
       calibration:
         units: um  # Target units, starting from volts. The calibration thus would be: device_value (true units) = slope*volts+offset
         slope: 1
         offset: 0
       limits:
         min: 0um
         max: 10um
       default: 5um

Note that the first key is the device to which the actuator is plugged. If defining actuators or sensors in the same file, they should be nested according to the device to which they are plugged. The first key afterwards is the name of the device and should be unique; if not, it will be overriden by the latest sensor/actuator loaded. The two more important pieces of information are the calibration and limits. The first explains the program how to convert from volts (the natural units of any ADQ) to the units of the actuator/sensor. The latter is for safety purposes and to maximize the convertion resolution of the DAQ that support setting variable gains.

None of the keys specified here are mandatory, but common sense dictates that the ones shown in the example are the minimum required ones for an experiment.

Defining the Experiment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The experiment, following the scheme developed for devices, sensors and actuators, is layed out in a YAML file. When writing it, the user has to keep in mind what are the parameters that need to be used, the kind of measurements that have to be achieved, etc. At this stage it is only a matter of thinking, the real logic and communication with devices will come later.

For example, if we want to scan the wavelength of a laser, we would write something like this::

   init:
     devices: 'config/devices.yml'
     sensors: 'config/sensors.yml'
     actuators: 'config/actuators.yml'

   scan:
     laser:
       name: Santec Laser
       params:
         start_wavelength: 1491 nm
         stop_wavelength:  1510 nm
         wavelength_speed:  10 nm/s
         interval_trigger: 0.01 nm
         sweep_mode: ContOne
         wavelength_sweeps: 1
     detectors:
       NI-DAQ:
         - Photodiode Test
         - Photodiode 2

   finish:
     laser:
       shutter: False

You see that by laying down the experiment like this, it is easier to decie what we should do 'under the hood'. Of course, this example was already iterated; normally, you would write down fewer parameters, and while developing the code, you'll realized you forgot to declare an important variable, then you go back and you added, etc.

Block by block::

   init:
     devices: 'config/devices.yml'
     sensors: 'config/sensors.yml'
     actuators: 'config/actuators.yml'

Of course the first step is to established where the config files are. Having it explicitly stated enables the user to keep several config files for different experiments, but with the same underlying logic. May not be initially apparent why at the beginning, but it becomes clearer with time.

The second block is where we actually define what scan we want to do::

   scan:
     laser:
       name: Santec Laser
       params:
         start_wavelength: 1491 nm
         stop_wavelength:  1510 nm
         wavelength_speed:  10 nm/s
         interval_trigger: 0.01 nm
         sweep_mode: ContOne
         wavelength_sweeps: 1
     detectors:
       NI-DAQ:
         - Photodiode Test
         - Photodiode 2

The first key, `laser` establishes what device we are going to scan. The name here, as you may have guessed, is the name we gave to the device when we defined it in `devices.yml`. The block of `parmas` sets all the parameters we need to make a scan, i.e., the starting wavelength, the stop wavelength, etc. At this moment I won't enter into the details of the chosen names, but they are closely related to properties in the driver of the laser.

Finally, the `detectors` block determines what detectors are going to be monitored while the laser is scanning. They are nested according to the device to which they are plugged to.

There are few things worth noting before moving forward. First, there is no need of any more information for performing a scan. However you see also that we are not establishing any logic to the measurement, meaning, for example, when and how we trigger it.

Experimentor is thought in such a way that the logic should be hardcoded into the Python code. However, if it is important to have the flexibility of altering a trigger behavior, etc. one could add an extra parameter in the scan block that later will be interpreted by the Python code.

Finally, we have to do something when the experiment finishes, in our case we only want to close the shutter::

   finish:
     laser:
       shutter: False

The overall structure of the yaml file may look a bit more involved than needed by simple experiments; for example we explicitly state which laser we use, while we could have hard coded this (there is only one laser plugged into the experiment). However keeping a more flexible approach enables users to re utilize code more easily. Scanning a laser today may be scanning a stepper motor tomorrow.
